<h3>About Me</h3>
 <p>I'm a Data Scientist  at <a href="http://www.x.ai">X.AI Inc.</a> Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science at University of Delaware in 2014. </p>

 <p>I am broadly interested in the field of information retrieval, natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in the study and development of effective and efficient evaluation techniques that help us measure how well search systems satisfy user needs.</p>

 <p>Thus far, I have conducted research on these topics and worked on the following research problems:  evaluation of retrieval,  question answering systems that have applications in a variety of domains, including web search, recommendation systems, and healthcare. As a result of this work, I created open-source tools, contributed to commercial software and published in leading academic conferences.</p>

 <p>A pdf version of my CV can be found <a href="/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

 <p>More information about my research projects can be found here. Please take a look around to learn more about my work and email me if you have any questions or comments!</p>
